## Git Development

- "develop" branch is protected, only administrators are authorized to write
- When developing new features, create new "feature/FeatureName" branch from "develop"
- Always pull the latest "develop" branch and merge into your own feature branch before you start your work and when you find out new commits appear in "develop" branch
