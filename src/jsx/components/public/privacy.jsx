                <p>Welcome to EasyCourse (the “<b>Site</b>”) of Colevate Inc. (“Colevate”, “EasyCourse”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>” and/or “<b>our</b>”).
                This Site is operated by Colevate and has been created to provide information about our company and its products and services (the
                “<b>Products</b>”) to you as a visitor to our Site or user of our Products (“<b>you</b>” and/or “<b>your</b>”). This Privacy Policy
                sets forth EasyCourse’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“<b>Personal Data</b>”), that is
                collected from visitors to the Site and users of the Products.</p><br />

                <h4><b>Information We Collect:</b></h4>
                <p>When you interact with us through our Site or Products, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further
                  described below:</p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal Data That You Provide through the Site or Products:
                  </b> We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide suchinformation, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond
                  to one of our surveys, purchase a Product, register your Product or otherwise use certain Products.  In addition, when you access or use
                  a Product we may collect metrics on your activities, such as web pages visited, length of visit, and which features of our product you
                  use. In order to have access to certain Products and/or to purchase certain items, you may be required to provide credit card detail or
                  other acceptable payment information.  Wherever EasyCourse collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p><b>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you
                  provide Personal Data to us through the Site or in connection with any Product, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
                  transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of EasyCourse and the authorized third parties referred to herein located
                  in the United States. </b></p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Other Information: </b>

                  <b>Non-Identifiable Data:</b> When you interact with EasyCourse through the Site or any Product, we receive and store certain personally
                  non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically
                  identify you. EasyCourse may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by EasyCourse
                  affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of
                  visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers and the use of
                  our Products. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
                </p>

                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  In operating the Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to
                  your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.
                  For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more
                  than once during a visit to the Site. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information
                  on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because
                  they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.
                </p>

                <p>

                  The Site also automatically captures IP addresses. EasyCourse uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movement, ensure
                  the security of your interaction with the Site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
                </p>

                  <b>Aggregated Personal Data:</b> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site and Products, EasyCourse often conducts research
                  on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled
                  and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and EasyCourse may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate
                  information does not identify you personally. EasyCourse may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Products to current
                  and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
                </p><br />

                <h4><b>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</b></h4>
                <p>EasyCourse uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain
                  reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use
                  the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to purchase or register a
                  Product, we will use your Personal Data to permit you to conduct such activities.  EasyCourse and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related
                  Companies”) may also use your Personal Data as well as personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site and Products to help us
                  improve the content and functionality of the Site and Products, provide customers with Product updates, better understand our users and improve the
                  Site and Products. EasyCourse and its Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about products or services
                  we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving
                  future communications.  In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our
                  mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
                <p>
                  If EasyCourse intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such
                  anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
                </p><br />

                <h4><b>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</b></h4>
                <p>
                  EasyCourse is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.
                  There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as
                  set forth below:

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Business Transfers:</b> As we develop our business, we might sell
                  or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be
                  part of the transferred assets.

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</b> EasyCourse, like

                  information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide
                  them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
